A Food app



### Features (The listed features)
### Home Page
Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

### Meal Detail Page
Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

### My favourite meals Page
Display a list of all the favourite meals.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.




### Plan
1. Fetch data from API
2. Search Bar Functionality
3. Render the Selected item from Search Bar
4. Render all the items
5. Create a Separate My favourites Page
